# üçæ Getting started

## Description

zMenus is a comprehensive inventory plugin.

You can create custom inventories and link them to custom commands. With the button system, you can fully customize your inventories to the highest degree.

Each inventory needs to be created in its own file, and you can organize these files into folders.

The plugin also features an advanced API that allows other developers to use the same inventory configuration system. You can seamlessly link inventories from multiple plugins without any issues. The goal of this API is to provide a uniform configuration for a better user experience.
