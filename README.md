# üçæ Getting Started with zMenus

## What is zMenus?

zMenus is a powerful inventory management plugin for Minecraft servers, offering complete customization over in-game inventories. With zMenus, you can create custom inventories and link them to specific commands, giving you full control over the player experience.

The plugin uses a flexible button system, allowing you to configure every aspect of your inventories to suit your needs. You can create and organize each inventory in its own file, and group related inventories into folders for better organization.

zMenus also includes an advanced API for developers, making it easy to integrate with other plugins using the same inventory system. This means you can link inventories across multiple plugins seamlessly, enhancing the overall server experience.
