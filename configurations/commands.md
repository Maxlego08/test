# Commands

## Informations

The plugin has an `commands` folder that will contain all your commands. You can create an infinite number of commands. A command will contain the name of the command, its aliases, its permission and the name of the inventory to open.\
You can put several commands per file and create an unlimited number of files.

```
|- commands
  |- punish
    - punish.yml
  |- example
    - example.yml

```

Allows you to add arguments to your commands. You can use the arguments with the following placeholder: `%zmenu_argument_<argument name>%`&#x20;

#### Example

```yaml
commands:
  punish:
    command: punish
    permission: "admin.punish"
    aliases:
      - sanction
    inventory: example_punish
    arguments:
      - name: target
      - name: reason
        auto-completion:
          - cheat
          - chat
          - skin
          - other
        actions:
          - type: message
            messages:
              - "&7You will put a punishment to the player &f&n%target%&r &7with the reason&8: &f%reason%"
```

You can define an [action](buttons/actions.md) and auto-completion list for each action.

You can define whether an argument and required or not with the value `isRequired`, Iâ€™ll show you that in the example below.

You can not execute the actions of the main command with the value `performMainAction`

Here you have the command **`/punish <target> <reason`**> . So you can run the command this way: `/punish Maxlego08 Cheat (fly)`.

With the placeholders you will be able to retrieve the arguments:

| Placeholder               | Result        |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| `%zmenu_argument_target%` | `Maxlego08`   |
| `%zmenu_argument_reason%` | `Cheat (fly)` |

You can define whether the argument is optional and whether the argument has a specific inventory.

#### Example with no required argument:

```yaml
commands:
  warp:
    command: warp
    aliases:
      - warps
    inventory: warp
    arguments:
      - name: warp
        isRequired: false # Set the argument as optional
        performMainAction: false # Does not open inventory
        auto-completion:
          - minapvp
          - cajas
          - dungeon
          - encantamientos
          - jugadores
          - mercado
          - minas
          - rankup
        actions:
          - type: player_command
            commands:
              - "essentials:warp %zmenu_argument_warp% %player%"
```

This example opens a warp inventory, then with an argument to teleport the player to the desired warp using an aliase of essentials.
